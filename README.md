Cs50 Repository


Hi, I'm Jennifer Chika from Nigeria. Taking the Cs50 course for me has been surprisingly interesting. I'm completely focused on getting my certificate before the end of this year. I'm focused on aquiring all the knowledge, skill and certification i need from this platform because i'll be leaving my country soon. I don't really have much to say about myself because everything i've already said about myself is all i can think of. I do hope to have more fun studying. I'm happy to be part of this.
